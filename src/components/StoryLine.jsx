                In <em>Odin's Gaze</em>, you are a skilled seeker selected by the great Norse god
                Odin to find hidden objects using his powerful tool. With your sharp eyesight and
                puzzle-solving abilities, you must explore a variety of locations and discover
                objects hidden in plain sight.

                As you progress through increasingly difficult levels, you'll encounter unique
                objects and challenging puzzles that require your full attention. With Odin's Gaze,

                to become the ultimate seeker? The power of Odin's Gaze is in your hands.
